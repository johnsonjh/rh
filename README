An ANSI/ISO C compiler is required

If rhlex.c is deleted then you must have flex version 2.4.6 or higher
to create it.

If getdate.c, rhgram.c, or rhgram.h is deleted then you must have perl-byacc
version 1.8.3 or higher to create the deleted file(s).


KNOWN BUGS:

	The pointer to the error in error messages may be wrong. (Actually,
	it is more likely to be wrong than correct.)

	Function parameters can not have the same names as functions.
	Example:
		b(c) { return c + 2; }
		a(b) { return b + 2; }	/* won't compile - b is a function */ 

	The file system operator only works on SunOS 4.1.x

	No configure script - coming RSN!
